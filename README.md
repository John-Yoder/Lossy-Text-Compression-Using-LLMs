# Lossy-Text-Compression-Using-LLMs
Just a fun prototpye I made that works as lossy compression for text. 
Compresses the text to sqrt(length) by summarizing the text, then it is decompressed into a length comprable to that of the original text.
Uses gpt-4o-mini right now but other models could be easily swapped in.

A similar idea could be usedul for Search Engine Optimization, or Language Translation.
